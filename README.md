# EMG

# this was a group project (prototype) consisting on multiple computer scientist, several biomedical engineerers and one industrial engineer.

# this code is uncomplete and unfinished (requires some minor changes and other files like an sdk or the hardware for the myo armband).

# the goal of this project was to use the data provided by the myoband (position and gestures) to construct an alphabet.

# the function of this proyotype is to produce letters for each gesture, in each position, available.

it can also "predict" some words that are in a notebook file by taking into account the first letter(s).
